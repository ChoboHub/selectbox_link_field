This is an extension for Symphony linking two sections together.

- Version: 1.15dev
- Date: **unreleased**
- Requirements: Symphony 2.0.x
- Author: Symphony Team, team@symphony-cms.com

## Synopsis

This extension offers a simple way to link data. Add this field to your section, tell it which other section you want to link it to and you will get a drop box with all those entries to choose from. Linking is performed via the System ID value, so the link remains even when the linked entryâ€™s field changes its value, a common problem with just using the standard Select box field with dynamic options.

### Notes

Setting an instance of the field to be not required will cause an empty option to show up on the publish form.
