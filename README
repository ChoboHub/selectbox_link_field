Select Box Link Field
------------------------------------

Version: 1.4
Author: Symphony Team (team@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 5th Jan 2009
Requirements: Symphony Beta revision 5 or greater.

A replacement field for the Section Link field of Symphony 2 Rev5


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'selectbox_link_field' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Select Box Link ", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Select Box Link" field to your sections.


[USAGE]

- Works in a near identical way to the standard select box field, however there is no static 
option and entries are linked internally via their ID, meaning that if an entry is changed,
any Select Box Link fields will not lose their link to that entry. The data on the front-end 
is presented in a way identical to that of a Section Link.

- Setting an instance of the field to be not required will cause an empty option to show up on
the publish form.



[CHANGE LOG]

1.4		- Enable Data Source param output for this field

1.3		- Fixed bug introduced in 1.2 that caused table values to disappear if the first field
		  of the section is a "Select Box Link".

1.2		- Should correctly work with fields that do now use a 'value' column in the 
		  database. This would cause an empty select box.

1.1 	- Added ability to set field to required/not required.
		- Added multi-select property (thanks to czheng)
